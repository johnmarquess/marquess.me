This website was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. It takes a little experience with markdown, HTML and Jekyll confdiguration to set up, but no Ruby skills are required.

I work as analytics lead for a State Governemt agency in Queensland, Australia. This website is my personal blog to keep track of my projects, learning, and different trickery related to data and analytics. I also like to use a bit of SQL where I can to clean up data before I put it through other code. I also dabble with [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-au/).

I am passionate about data analytics and data science and I enjoy coding. I am reasonably proficient in [python](https://www.python.org/) programming for data science, and excellent [R programming](https://cran.r-project.org/) skills, especially the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages.  I have sound understanding of machine learning concepts and techniques.
